The ``results`` folder contains example scripts for using the results of a model-fit.

The majority of results scripts are given in the ``dataset_1d/results`` folder.

The API for inspecting the results of most quantities (e.g. the non-linear samples) is the same irrespective
of the dataset fitted.Therefore, please refer to the folder `autocti_workspace/*/dataset_1d/results` for example scripts, which can
be copy and pasted into scripts which model charge injection imaging.

The `imaging_ci/results` package does include example scripts for functionality specific to charge injection imaging
datasets.

The ``plot` folder contains scripts which show how to use **PyAutoCTI** built-in visualization tools.

The **PyAutoCTI** API provides a simple interface with matplotlib for making plots that does not require the user to
write any matplotlib code themselves.

This is illustrate in the ``start_here.py`` / ``start_here.ipynb`` file, which I strongly recommend new users read!

Files (Beginner)
----------------

- ``start_here.py``: An introduction to plotting and visualization (RECOMMENDED READ).

Folders (Beginner)
------------------

- ``plotters``: Plotters which plot specific **PyAutoCTI** objects (e.g. ``Dataset1DPlotter``).
- ``search``: Visualization tools for the results of a non-linear search (e.g. ``NestPlotter``).
- ``ccd``: Make subplot of all images at all charge injection levels for a single CCD.
- ``fpa``: Make subplot of all images for a full focal plane array.

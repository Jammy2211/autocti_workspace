The ``chaining`` folder contains examples scripts illustrating the non-linear search chaining feature for charge injection imaging datasets.

Folders (Advanced)
------------------

- ``pipelines``: CTI modeling pipelines that use search chaining to fit a model using multiple non-linear searches.

Files (Advanced)
----------------

- ``x1_species_to_x2_species.py``: Fit a one species CTI model followed by a 2 species CTI model.
- ``noise_scaling.py``: Use noise scaling to balance the contribution of datasets with a large variation in signal to noise.

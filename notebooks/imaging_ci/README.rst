The ``imaging_ci`` folder contains example scripts for analysing 2D charge injection CTI Calibration datasets.


Folders (Beginner)
------------------

- ``correction``: How to correct a charge inejction dataset from CTI using a known CTI model.
- ``modeling``: Examples showing how to fit simple models to charge injection datasets.
- ``simulators``: Scripts used to simulate example charge injection datasets fitted throughout examples.
- ``results``: How to use the results of a model-fit.
- ``data_preparation``: data preparation charge injection data before using it to calibrate CTI (e.g. cosmic ray flagging).

Files (Beginner)
----------------

- ``extract``: Extracting regions of a charge injection dataset (e.g. FPRs, EPERs) for analysis and visualization.

Folders (Advanced)
------------------

- ``advanced``: Advanced examples for more experienced users.

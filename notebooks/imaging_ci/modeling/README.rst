The ``modeling`` folder contains example scripts showing how to fit a model to uniform charge injection
CTI calibration data.

Uniform charge injection data assumes the injected charge in every column is identical (as opposed to non-uniform
charge injection data, where each column has a different injected signal).

The ``advanced`` folder contains scripts for charge injection imaging data with additional features, for example
non-uniform charge injection lines or cosmic rays.

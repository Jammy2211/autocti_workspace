The ``advanced`` folder contains scripts for charge injection imaging data with additional features, for example
non-uniform charge injection lines or cosmic rays.

Folders (Advanced)
------------------

- ``uniform_cosmic_rays``: Fitting charge injection data with uniform charge injection and cosmic rays.
- ``non_uniform``: Fitting charge injection data with uniform charge injection where every column is injected with a different level of charge.

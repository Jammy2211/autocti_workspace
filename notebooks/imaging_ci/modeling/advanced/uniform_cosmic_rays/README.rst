The ``modeling/uniform_cosmic_rays`` folder contains example scripts showing how to fit a model to uniform
charge injection CTI calibration data which contains cosmic rays.

Uniform charge injection data assumes the injected charge in every column is identical (as opposed to non-uniform
charge injection data, where each column has a different injected signal).

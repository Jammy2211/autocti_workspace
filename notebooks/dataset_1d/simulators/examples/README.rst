The ``examples`` folder contains example scripts for simulating 1D CTI datasets using functionality not
described in ``start_here.ipynb``

Files (Beginner)
----------------

These scripts simulate 1D CTI datasets where:

- ``species_x3.py``: There are three trap species.
- ``species_x1_continuum.py``: There is one trap species whoSe release times are sampled from a continuum.
- ``overview.py``: The dataset is used to illustrate PyAutoCTI in the overview examples.
- ``temporal.py``: Datasets taken over time with gradually increasing CTI.
